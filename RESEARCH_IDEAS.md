1. Fine tune existing models on new genres (wave)
   - https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08706
      - maybe add more tunable parameters
3. Fine tuning baroque counter point model, maybe RL (midi). Symbolic music generation with rule based systems (i.e. counterpoints)
4. Wave, testing GAN vs diffusion (personal implementation)
